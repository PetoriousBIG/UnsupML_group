# Project Plan/Outline

Just putting this out there for feedback and thoughts.

## Datasets

Two datasets selected – if anyone would like to replace one or the other with a different dataset, please speak now or forever hold your peace!

- **Dataset #1**: [Fraud detection on eBay](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/562/shill+bidding+dataset)
- **Dataset #2**: [Low-dimensional retail data (Customer segmentation?)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)

## Tasks

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We will need a comprehensive exploratory data analysis performed on each dataset, which will guide:
- Handling missing values (if needed)
- Scaling
- One-hot encoding
- Feature Transformation

This will require written materials to support our decisions.

### Clustering Techniques

We will apply five different clustering techniques to each dataset:

1. **Partitional:** Spectral Clustering
2. **AHC (Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering):** BIRCH
3. **Density-Based:** DBSCAN
4. **Grid-Based:** CLIQUE
5. **Model & Graph-Based:** Gaussian Mixture Model

### Presentation and Report

- Prepare slides and a written report.
- Each clustering technique should be documented by the person conducting it.
- We will need a **slide deck beautifier** to format and unify the slides.
- An **editor-in-chief** will finalize the written report.
